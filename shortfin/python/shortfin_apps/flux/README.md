# Flux.1 Server and CLI

This directory contains a [Flux](https://blackforestlabs.ai/#get-flux) inference server, CLI and support components. More information about FLUX.1 on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev).

## Install

To get your environment ready, follow the [developer guide](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/blob/main/docs/developer_guide.md)

## Prepare artifacts

The flux model weights are gated. Once you have access, clone the huggingface repository for [FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev). Then run the following:
```
./sharktank/sharktank/pipelines/flux/export_from_hf.sh /absolute/path/to/flux/folder/ <flux_dev>
```

## Start Flux Server
The server will prepare runtime artifacts for you.

By default, the port is set to 8000. If you would like to change this, use `--port` in each of the following commands.

You can check if this (or any) port is in use on Linux with `ss -ntl | grep 8000`.

The first time you run the server, you may need to wait for artifacts to download.

From a source checkout of shortfin, you must run from the `/shortfin` directory:
```
python -m shortfin_apps.flux.server --model_config=./python/shortfin_apps/flux/examples/flux_dev_config.json --device=hip --fibers_per_device=1 --workers_per_device=1 --isolation="per_fiber" --build_preference=precompiled

```
 - Wait until your server outputs:
```
INFO - Application startup complete.
INFO - Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
## Run the Flux Client

 - Run a CLI client in a separate shell:
```
python -m shortfin_apps.flux.simple_client --interactive
```

Enter your prompts. The generated images will be stored at `./gen_imgs/`!

### Update flags

Please see --help for both the server and client for usage instructions.
